description=SafehousePlus is a complete overhaul of the game's safehouse system, adding numerous new features and customization options. With a redesigned and clean interface, players can join and manage multiple safehouses simultaneously without needing to travel to them to add friendsâ€”no need to even be online. The mod allows adjusting the member limit per base, fixes bugs (such as owning infinite safehouses), and introduces real-time visualization of safehouse boundaries, preventing constructions outside the protected area.
