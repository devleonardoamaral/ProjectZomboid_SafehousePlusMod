description=[h1]How does it work?[/h1]  
description=SafehousePlus is a complete overhaul of the game's safehouse system, adding numerous new features and customization options. With a redesigned and clean interface, players can join and manage multiple safehouses simultaneously without needing to travel to them to add friends?no need to even be online. The mod allows adjusting the member limit per base, fixes bugs (such as owning infinite safehouses), and introduces real-time visualization of safehouse boundaries, preventing constructions outside the protected area.
